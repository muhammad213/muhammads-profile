      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Muhammad Shahzad, a dedicated and versatile IT professional with a strong foundation in systems administration, helpdesk support, and cloud technologies. Over the span of 10 years, Iâ€™ve built my expertise from the ground up â€” starting in Tier 1 and 2 support, and growing into roles where Iâ€™ve maintained and optimized core infrastructure, supported hybrid environments, and contributed to cloud adoption strategies.
        <br><br>
        Iâ€™ve worked extensively in environments such as Windows, MacOS, MSP's, and financial sector, managing everything from user provisioning and endpoint troubleshooting to system performance tuning and patch management. My approach is hands-on, detail-oriented, and always focused on stability, security, and end-user satisfaction.
        <br><br>
        Whether deploying virtual machines in Azure/ScreenConnect, supporting remote desktop environments, managing network configurations, or resolving complex support tickets, I bring an approachable, technical mindset and a constant drive to learn and improve. Thanks for taking a look at my profile and I hope to connect with you soon!

      <h2>Work History</h2>
      <div class="job">
        <h3>Information Technology Specialist lvl. 3 <span>- SecurityNational Financial Corporation</span></h3>
        <p class="date">August 2020 â€“ July 2025</p>
        <p>
          As a senior member of the IT team, I provided comprehensive technical support to over 4,000 internal and external users across distributed office locations across the U.S. I was the escalation point for complex incidents involving infrastructure, cloud services, endpoint management, and network operations.
          <br><br>
          I led key initiatives including the full IT decommissioning of offices across the U.S., most notably, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Florida, and Utah, large-scale infrastructure deployments during remote expansions, and hardware/software rollouts across the enterprise. My role extended to direct collaboration with senior leadership, where I delivered critical support and contributed to long-term IT planning.
          <br><br>
          I ensured high availability of systems through 24/7 coverage, proactive network monitoring, and the use of platforms like Employee Service Desk, PRTG, Splunk, and more. I also managed company assets, licenses, user permissions/accesses, and cloud environments (Azure, Active Directory, OneDrive, Sharepoint), and maintained compliance through structured logging and lifecycle tracking.

      <div class="job">
        <h3>Business Development <span>- Easterns Automotive Group</span></h3>
        <p class="date">November 2019 â€“ August 2020</p>
        <p>
          In this role, I used Microsoft 365 and digital platforms to help streamline the sales process and improve customer engagement. I created structured workflows using Excel, Outlook, Teams, and Skype for Business, which helped increase lead conversions and drive steady revenue growth.
          <br><br>
          I regularly hosted virtual vehicle walk-throughs through Zoom and social media channels, giving clients a closer look at inventory and building stronger interest in our offerings. I also designed sales visuals and warranty breakdowns using Visio and Photoshop to make technical information more approachable and easier to understand.
          <br><br>
          By tracking customer data and online activity, I was able to adjust outreach strategies, overcome objections, and build stronger connections with potential buyers. I worked closely with the sales team to refine our approach through daily training and played an active role in increasing close rates and improving overall team performance.
          <br><br>
          My focus on clear communication, responsiveness, and follow-through helped build trust with clients and led to repeat business, referrals, and stronger brand loyalty.
